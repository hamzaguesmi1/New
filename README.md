# F&E DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT

3.1	Introduction

Application architecture refers to the design and structure the FE Project. It defines how the different components of the application interact with each other, how data flows between them, and how they collectively fulfill the applicationâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements.

3.2	Solution Overview:
This document presents the solution architecture for the data analytics project serving the Fertility and Endo department. The aim is to provide valuable insights on medications and enable better business/client decisions.

3.3	Application Layers:
The solution is designed as a data value chain, starting with dataset ingestion, followed by data processing and storage. Downstream, data visualization is implemented to offer UpToDate, consistent, and reliable data visualization for end-users.

## Overview

Here you want to write a short overview of the goals of your project and how it works at a high level. If possible, include one or two images of the end product and architecture diagram (see examples below). diagrams.net is a great tool for creating architecture diagrams.
